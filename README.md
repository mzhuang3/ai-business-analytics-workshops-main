## Credits

The dataset used in this series of workshops for demonstrating the deployment of AI tools (i.e., LLMs-based agents) to conduct both traditional and machine-learning-based business analytics is from the [Online Retail dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail). 

The Online Retail dataset, available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu), contains transactional data from a UK-based online retail store. It is commonly used for data analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence applications such as customer segmentation, sales forecasting, and market basket analysis.
